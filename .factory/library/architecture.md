# Architecture

## System Overview

Focault (bundle ID: com.colbychang.focus) is a native iOS app (iOS 17.0+) for focus mode management and screen time analytics. The display name is "Focault" but the bundle ID, scheme name, and code references use "Focus". It uses Apple's Screen Time API for OS-level app blocking, SwiftData for persistence, and ActivityKit for Dynamic Island integration.

## Target Structure

```

├── FocusCore (Swift Package)           -- Shared models, protocols, utilities
├── DeviceActivityMonitorExtension      -- Handles scheduled focus mode start/end
├── ShieldConfigurationExtension        -- Custom blocked-app shield UI
├── ShieldActionExtension               -- Handles shield button taps
├── DeviceActivityReportExtension       -- Custom screen time report views

```

## Package Architecture

**FocusCore** is the shared Swift Package imported by ALL targets. It contains:
- SwiftData models (VersionedSchema)
- Protocol abstractions for Screen Time services
- Mock implementations for testing
- Shared constants (App Group ID, store names)
- Business logic (timer, trend detection, averages)

## Data Flow

### Cross-Process Communication
Extensions run in separate processes. The ONLY reliable communication mechanism is **App Group UserDefaults** (`group.com.colbychang.focus.shared`).

```
Main App ←→ UserDefaults(suiteName: appGroupID) ←→ Extensions
```

All shared state uses **flag + timestamp** pattern (never boolean alone) to prevent stale state from crashes.

### Persistence Layers
- **SwiftData** (main app only): Focus mode profiles, deep focus sessions, screen time entries, analytics data. Uses in-memory containers for tests.
- **App Group UserDefaults**: Cross-extension state (active sessions, blocking status, serialized tokens).
- **ManagedSettingsStore**: OS-level shield persistence (survives reboots). Named stores per focus mode profile.

## Key Patterns

### Protocol Abstraction Layer
All Screen Time APIs are accessed through protocols:
- `AuthorizationServiceProtocol` → Real: `AuthorizationCenter.shared` / Mock: `MockAuthorizationService`
- `ShieldServiceProtocol` → Real: `ManagedSettingsStore` / Mock: `MockShieldService`
- `MonitoringServiceProtocol` → Real: `DeviceActivityCenter` / Mock: `MockMonitoringService`
- `LiveActivityServiceProtocol` → Real: ActivityKit `Activity` / Mock: `MockLiveActivityService`

This enables full testability without the Family Controls entitlement.

### Triple-Blocking Architecture
Focus mode enforcement uses three independent layers:
1. **Shield Extension** — OS-level intercept when user opens a blocked app
2. **DeviceActivityMonitor** — Scheduled background checks for re-blocking
3. **Main App foreground check** — Re-apply blocking on app activation

### Named ManagedSettingsStore per Profile
Each focus mode profile gets its own named `ManagedSettingsStore` (named by profile UUID). This ensures:
- Independent shield management per profile
- Deactivating one doesn't affect others
- Clean cleanup on profile deletion

### Deep Focus Session State Machine
```
.idle → .active → .completed
           ↓           ↑
       .onBreak ────────┘
           ↓           ↑
     .bypassing ────────┘
           ↓
      .abandoned
```

### Timer Architecture
- Main session timer: counts down `remainingSeconds`, pauses during breaks
- Bypass countdown: independent 60-second timer, runs alongside main timer
- Break timer: independent, shown in Dynamic Island via Live Activity using `Text(timerInterval:)`
- Background handling: record timestamp on background, compute elapsed on foreground

## Data Model Overview

### FocusMode
Profile with name, icon, color, schedule (days/times), app selection (serialized tokens), isActive flag.

### DeepFocusSession
Session record: start time, duration, remaining time, status (active/onBreak/bypassing/completed/abandoned), bypass count, break count, total break duration, allowed apps config.

### ScreenTimeEntry
Per-app or per-category usage record linked to a session, used for analytics.

### BlockedAppGroup
Named group of app tokens for category-based analytics aggregation.

## Key Constraints

1. **No Family Controls entitlement yet** — all Screen Time calls go through protocol mocks
2. **Extensions cannot share databases** — UserDefaults only for cross-process state
3. **Max 20 DeviceActivity schedules** — schedule architecture must be conservative
4. **DeviceActivity schedules unreliable >45 min** — chain shorter schedules
5. **Opaque tokens** — cannot determine which specific app a token represents
6. **Shield extension memory limit ~6MB** — keep extension code minimal
7. **Simulator limitations** — Screen Time callbacks don't fire, test via mocks
